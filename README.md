# car-rental-ui

The web application aims to simulate a car rental. The user can view a list of available cars. The rental and return dates as well as a currency can be selected. Afterwards the car can be booked and is no longer in the list.
The booking can be viewed at any time by logging in with booking number and last name.
The booking can be viewed and edited by an admin in the admin portal. Also, an admin can manage the cars and create new ones.
Via Google Places API it is possible to see the locations of the car rental.

The purpose of the application is to present the previously taught contents of the course Service Engineering. The basic requirements are:
- The creation of a car rental application.
